RNI viz for Shadrock and Rockefeller to plot projects and milestones. Lovingly forked from Aure.

Check out the [Pirate Plotr Render here](http://auremoser.github.io/pirateplotr/).

### about
This is a simple sortable chart for viewing projects and tracking them on a timeline. 

This is mostly for pirates @Ushahidi but also for everyone to have a global view of what's going on when and how the milestones/expectations/resourcing needs shake out.

### how to
1. ~~Edit the csv in the /data folder to your desired plotting verbage.~~[1]
1. Edit data in the Google Spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ushahidi.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlR1bR7sxqL-dFhnYWRNUm81WWNUai0ybjZRcWwyNXc&usp=sharing).
2. Spreadsheet will update in the chart on a semi-frequent basis (depends on google, usually you can refresh the [Pirate Plotr Render](http://auremoser.github.io/pirateplotr/) every 5 minutes and it will show your changes); all changes will be checked and QAuto-integrated for Monday morning calls.
3. View and Sort the chart! [Check the Pirate Plotr Render page.](http://auremoser.github.io/pirateplotr/)

### data
Data csv looks like this:

![data.csv](https://raw2.github.com/auremoser/images/master/plotr-sheet.png)

Headers are static, but all values are editable in the data.csv file.

deliverable	| priority	| start_date	| end_date 	| team | type
:---:	| :----: 	| :--------: 	| :------: 	| :----: | :----:
project1 | value1 	| date1 		| date2 	| [V3/CrisisNet/...] | external
project2 | value2 	| date1 		| date2 	| [V3/CrisisNet/...] | core

#### key
* **deliverable** is project name
* **priority** is an arbitrary weight (price point? resources?)[2]
* **dates** are the start and end date of a project
* **team** is the name of the team responsible for the deliverable
* **type** is one of 4 categories for filtering purposes (core, external, ops, milestone)[3]

This is spreadsheet-powered because that's a maintainable format for all contributors; easily editable/updatable.

Yays thanks for reading! Shoot me questions if you have any: aurelia@ushahidi.com.

[1]: Previously, I manually updated the /data/data.csv file and then populated that data in the chart. Now the chart is GDoc powered, to enable easier editing for all pirates in the party. :)

[2]: We can decide what numerical value to prioritize by, I just wanted to log this as a sortable placeholder for future values we might want to track.

[3]: Milestones are vertical plum lines on the chart. You can draw a plum line, as opposed to a bar, by entering a deliverable name, start_date and type of project as "milestone"). Check the csv for examples of this.
